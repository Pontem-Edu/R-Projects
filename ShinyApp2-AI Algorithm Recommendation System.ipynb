    "# AI Algorithm Recommendation System (Starter To Kick Off Your AI Project)\n",
    "## Background: \n",
    "So many ML/DL algorithm created on the open source right now . Beginign with an idea of help myself learn and categorize them, Suddenly have an idea of using the new tool- Shiny to create a tool for myself just for fun and learning purpose. It will be perfect to enforce my old software develop skills as well as deep understanding of AI/ML/DL algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this app is to guide myself( in the future other perople)to find recommend algorithm for ML/DL problem with \n",
    " - INPUT: \n",
    "          1. What do you want to do(txt analysis, predict category, predict value, recommendation, discover pattern, unsualy occurances, classify img)\n",
    "          2. Giving situation(datasetseg. Datasets situation: number, category..Is this need Demension Reduction?, Have label response, Predicting Numeric...) \n",
    "          3. What question you want to answer (result, purpose)\n",
    "          (...Near Future...)  text desciption input...\n",
    "          \n",
    " - OUTPUT:\n",
    "          1. ML/DL category(Unsupervised? supervised? Ensemble Learning, Reinforcement Learning, NN, DL...)\n",
    "          2. Algorithem recommendation ( RT, SVD, PCA, SVM, K-NN)\n",
    "          3. Algorithem Resource (link to the sampel code, link to the opensource, link to other real life example)\n",
    "          4.Preprocessing Data tricks and Tuning /pipline\n",
    "          4)(...Near Future...) embed the algorithm code inside the app...In someway after pick the recommend algorithm, it will also tabke inputs, datasets and run the algorithm give couple of the result back for comparasion , to help project start small, but start....\n",
    "          \n",
    "Research: Is there anything like this existing on the market????\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratege: \n",
    "1) Build excelsheet to list all the information ->2)Build structure of the app ->3)Testing with community(learn more from expert)->4)Refine the app towards AI PROJ KICKER (recommendor system)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes for the future to consider:-Advantage of this small app to kick start AI proj instead of AI vender missing the following:   \n",
    "1) how well does your model perform in the real time, your situation(lab)?\n",
    "2) how will your model suit my data, my unique needs, and my business patterns?\n",
    "3) How will you ensure this model performs well on my datasets?\n",
    "4) How the model will be local fit for indivdule datesets, workflow, user"
