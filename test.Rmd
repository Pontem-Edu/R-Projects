## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
investment_annual_summary <- read_csv("https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5756/datasets/d0251f26117bbcf0ea96ac276555b9003f4f7372/investment_annual_summary.csv")
investment_annual_summary
investment_services_projects<-read_csv("https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5756/datasets/bcb2e39ecbe521f4b414a21e35f7b8b5c50aec64/investment_services_projects.csv")
investment_services_projects
```
## Testing R code for dplyr 2012-china
```{r in_investment_services_projects_2012, echo=FALSE}
in_investment_services_projects_2012<-investment_services_projects%>%
      filter(country=="China",
             date_disclosed>="2011-07-01",
             date_disclosed<="2012-06-30")
 in_investment_services_projects_2012
```

```{r in_investment_services_projects_2012 sum}
in_investment_services_projects_2012_sum<-in_investment_services_projects_2012%>%
      summarize(sum_total_investment = sum(total_investment, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```
The total investment amount for all proj in China in 2012 fiscal year was `r in_investment_services_projects_2012_sum` million dollars

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```
### Investment Projects in Brazil

The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.
```{r China-investment-projects}
china_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == c) 

ggplot(china_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in China",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == c,
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  ) 
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r tables}
kable(investment_annual_summary, col.names = c("fiscal_year","region","dollars_in_millions"), align = "ccc", caption = "Table 1.1 The total investment summary for each region for the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years.")
```
